# spring-boot-app

 This is a simple “Hello World!” web application that highlights some of Spring Boot’s key features. We use Maven to build this project since most IDEs support it.
 Spring Boot 2.0.5.RELEASE requires Java 8 or 9, Spring Framework 5.0.9.RELEASE or above and Maven 3.2+. More details will be added in the near future.
